This repository contains the code (including the sequence .m files and .seq files) and exemplary data for paper "Effect of inhaled oxygen level on dynamic glucose-enhanced (DGE) MRI in mouse brain" published at Magnetic Resonance in Medicine

Note: The DGEcode used to process DGE data can be run directly after downloading. The sequence generation file writeOnVDMPSeqFile_BrainTissue.m and writeOnVDMPSeqFile_CSF.m can only be executed in pulseq-cest settings: https://github.com/kherz/pulseq-cest
